# incrementing_counter

- incrementing counter created using a hardcoded data-target attribute
- the counter increment is set by dividing the data-target (target) with a number of our choice. The increment can be modified depending on the steps or how long we want the counters to be, the higher the number target is divided by the longer it will display the counter effect
- setTimeout is used call the updateCounter function to give the counting effect or else it will just display that figure without the counter effect
